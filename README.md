I started this project with [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
npm start
```

## Building executable (linux only for now)

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
npm run build:exe:linux
```

I left same licence as it was in [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)
